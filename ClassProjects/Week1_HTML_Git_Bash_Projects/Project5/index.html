    Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. He is widely
    considered to be a brilliant businessman, as well as one of the greatest visionaries on our time.
    <br> <br>
    The story of his life is nothing short of fascinating. After dropping out of college, he started 
    Apple with his friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> in 
    1976 at the age of 21. The duo gained wealth and fame a year later for the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, one of the first highly successful 
    mass-produced personal computers. This was followed by the very successful Macintosh in 1984, the
    the first mass-produced computer with a GUI (graphical user interface). After being ousted of Apple
    in 1985, he went on to oversee the creation of two new companies: NeXT computer and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar">Pixar</a>. With the success of the movie Toy Story, Steve
    became a billionaire.
    <br><br>
    In 1997, Steve returned to Apple. Bill Gates and Microsoft dominated the computer industry, and Apple was
    on the brink of extinction. Nonetheless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">Steve was a fantastic salesman</a>,
    and used his business acumen to slowely bring the company back to profitability.
