    <h1>Oh, so you're a programmer now, huh?</h1>

    <p>Welcome to programming, the most lucrative career in the world.</p>

    <p>Being a programmer means you have now opened up a whole new world of endless possibilities.
        Instead simply being a passive user of technology, you are now a creator. You can create your own
        websites, social networks, mobile apps, and even games. You have the ability to create systems and
        environments that can reach potentially millions of people online. No other time in human history 
        has such a thing been possible. We are truly living in the future, my friends, and I am happy to 
        have you a part of it.  
    </p>

    <p>Here are some more benefits of being a programmer.</p>
