    <h2>Our cafe serves simply the best food you will taste. We guarantee it!</h2>
    <p>The Brunch Cafe was established in 2001 with one goal in mind: to serve our
        customers the finest breakfast food in the world. It is our profound belief
        that food should be delicious and good for you.</p>

    <p>You want eggs? <strong> We got it.</strong> You want coffee? <strong>We got it.</strong>
    We promise that we'll never cut corners or compromise on quality. We are also extremly proud
    of our wide selection of pastries. Our chef wakes up every morning at 2AM to make our baked goods 
    from scratch. <i>He literally sleeps only 3 or 4 hours a night!</i> With every bite into our croissants 
    and muffins, you'll taste a difference that sets up apart from our competitors. Trust us, you'll
    never go anywhere else!</p>

    <p>If you're not completely satisfied with our food, you don't have to pay! 
    (Just don't leave us a negative review on Yelp. We'll sue.)</p>
