    <h1>About JonArbuckle</h1>

    <p>Hi there everyone! My name is <u>Jon Arbuckle</u>. 
        I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives in Muncie, Indiana. 
        I am the proud owner of a cat named <strong>Garfield</strong> and a dog named <strong>Odie</strong>.
        Garfield is fat, lazy and loves to eat, while Odie is a dog withougt a brain. <br>
        Although my pets drive me <em>crazy</em>, I can't imagine life without them.
        <br> <br>
        I spend about hald my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. 
        I have to make sure to but all of Garfield's favorite foods, or else he'll get grumpy.
        This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with <br> marinera sauce,frozzen pizzas,
        and <strong>lots and lots</strong> of lasanga. When I come home, Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat everything in
        the grocery bag before I even have time to put it in the refrigerator. One time he ate everything that
        I bought in 30 <br> seconds, and I had to go back to the store to buy more food. <em>I wasn't too happy about that.</em>
